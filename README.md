# Todo

- add weighting
- add tf-idf
- maybe store document metadata elsewhere (i.e. amount of docs etc (for tfidf))
- use bs4 to calulcate weighting based on element (!!!!)
- create new types or extned current types is the answer
- find formula to use tf*idf with weighting
- precalculate tfidf
- use typing.typeddict to type metadata
